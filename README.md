and key activities we will be executing to bring our smart 
recycling solution to life. 

## Project Overview

SortiMate is our innovative solution to improve recycling efficiency by automatically sorting bottles, cans, and other recyclable waste. By combining sensor-based detection, machine learning, and real-time web monitoring, our project aims to reduce contamination, increase recycling participation, and promote sustainable practices in both public spaces and homes.

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Research & Feasibility Study
- **Objectives:**
  - Identify and evaluate current waste-sorting technologies.
  - Research machine learning models suitable for classifying recyclable materials.
  - Assess hardware options (sensors, Raspberry Pi, motors) and material durability.
  - Gather user requirements through surveys and interviews.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Conduct literature and market reviews.
  - Perform initial cost estimation and risk analysis.
  - Define detailed technical specifications.

### Phase 2: Prototype Design & Testing
- **Objectives:**
  - Develop an initial prototype integrating hardware and a basic detection algorithm.
  - Test sorting accuracy and system responsiveness.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Assemble the camera sensor, Raspberry Pi, and servo motors.
  - Implement a preliminary waste detection algorithm.
  - Test with sample data to evaluate system performance.
  - Collect feedback to refine the design.

### Phase 3: System Integration & Debugging
- **Objectives:**
  - Integrate hardware and software components into a unified system.
  - Ensure robust communication between the physical unit and the web platform.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Connect and synchronize sensors, actuation mechanisms, and the web dashboard.
  - Enhance the waste classification algorithm using a larger dataset.
  - Debug hardware-software interactions and optimize real-time updates.
  - Implement fail-safes and notification systems for maintenance.

### Phase 4: Final Implementation & Deployment
- **Objectives:**
  - Finalize the system design for public and domestic environments.
  - Deploy the smart bin in real-world settings and monitor performance.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Refine design based on integration testing and user feedback.
  - Enhance the web-based monitoring interface for ease of use.
  - Plan deployment logistics in targeted high-traffic areas.
  - Launch pilot deployments and iterate based on collected data.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Hardware Integration & Prototyping:**  
  Design, assemble, and test the physical components of the smart bin. Focus on sensor selection, durable yet aesthetically pleasing materials, and integrating actuation mechanisms for precise waste sorting.

- **Software Development & Web Integration:**  
  Develop the waste detection software and real-time monitoring dashboard. Create secure API connections between the binâ€™s hardware and the online interface, ensuring data flows seamlessly for user and administrator insights.

- **Machine Learning & Project Management:**  
  Lead the development and refinement of machine learning algorithms for accurate waste classification. Oversee the overall project timeline, coordinate between team members, and manage project milestones and risk assessments.
